	<h1>CD LECTURE 1</h1>
	<p>In the lecture, Elaine first talked about her past in education and her intepretation of "De-colonization" in Graphic design and how we can see things differently. When she mentioned the so-called "colonization" is based on "Capitalism" and "White supremacy" I was confused since she didn't clarify reasons behind. As the lecture go on, I really like the statement she made :" lets colonize design but in a good way". Personally, I am against the concept of "de-colonization". I believe the systematic standard of design was the choice of our society, it is the product of decades of design practices. However, I agree with its disruption towards innovative design that bases on culture of the minority or fresh creative outlook that was never discovered. Just like Elaine stated, "Let's colonize design", let's colonize design with less standards and limitation with more cultural diversity and perspective. Then, "colonization" in design will eventually become a "globalization" of creativity. The symposium of diverse cultural designs should not only be a media for people to recognize and respect, it should be a platform for people to get in touch outside the systematic design world. We as future designers should focus on promoting those designs instead of criticizing the lack of respect. I appreciate the insight of different cultural intepretation in this cd lecture. The intepretation of dominos inspired me to alienate myself from the "conventional" standard of what things should be. </p>

	<h1>CD LECTURE 2</h1>
	<p>This lecture is quite different from the previous ones. In this lecture the host Lynn Kiang made constructive questions and answers for studnets to pick, and end with answering all of them. I find the lecture itself to be very informative, Lynn Kiang basically introduced all of her experiences to us and really outlined what it's like to be a graphic designer in today's world. When she was talking about the "biggest" project she ever commissioned to do, I was interested on the decision making and what it takes for a graphic designer to make something physical successfully. During this question section, while Lynn is walking us through the project and the final presentation. I can't help to think about how the audience will preceive the actual installation. I started to simulate inside my head, what I can see is people are afriad to actually sit at those "sofa" and people are not as intrigued to interact with the panels and the informations. Then I asked myself why. The answer is it is not simply informative. What I mean my simply informative is the initial information preceived by audience in this museum lobby context is actually crucial. The lobby is pretty much a pathway and people don't stay around unless you make your point swift and simple. People walking around the installation may come across the pie chart and all the information about women's rights, but they won't really participate by sitting on those seats like what Lynn Kiang first invisioned. And that is for a simple reason, "they were not told to". I believe for a interactive installation to be successful, you must make a large portion of audience to actually interact and participate, by simply telling audience with a giant sign to "try sitting on them", might help the audience to decide to interact. Also in the women's history panel, I don't really see any sign indicating this is the section about women's right history, and a simple title saying what are these about. As a audience even if I'm interested in women's right, I probablly won't interact with the section since I have few idea of what it is actually about. I think to further make this installation successful, the site itself must have signs and marks guiding the audience what to do since the attention span is so low in the lobby. </p>

	<h1>CD LECTURE 3</h1>
	<p>In this lecture, Pascal showed us multiple creative projects and archives and focus on small things and paint a greater picture. I have checked the 45 phaistos projects' website, all the work being documented are really inspiring, the dinstict perspective on things we interact in our life makes me wonder the endless possibility with a creative mind. As the lecture continues, the concept pascal introduced "why the product exist, and how it has impacted our lives" is crucial in product design. Instead of making a television, we should not only think about the technical or mechanical functionaility of the tv itself, but to think about the greater concept behind it, which is to create a product that can bring families together in leisure times. As designers, we should all dig deeper into the audience demographic, dig deeper to the meaning of our end - product. Make the product touch people's heart rather than presenting what it is. In the beginning of the lecture, pascal mentioned how living in different places around the world, experiencing different culture and diverse graphic design and typography really changed his perspective towards art. If globalization is inevitable, we need to create more diverse designs and products to keep up the advancement, and incorporating different cultural elements would be the next step.  </p>
