	<h1>CD LECTURE 1</h1>
	<p>In the lecture, Elaine first talked about her past in education and her intepretation of "De-colonization" in Graphic design and how we can see things differently. When she mentioned the so-called "colonization" is based on "Capitalism" and "White supremacy" I was confused since she didn't clarify reasons behind. As the lecture go on, I really like the statement she made :" lets colonize design but in a good way". Personally, I am against the concept of "de-colonization". I believe the systematic standard of design was the choice of our society, it is the product of decades of design practices. However, I agree with its disruption towards innovative design that bases on culture of the minority or fresh creative outlook that was never discovered. Just like Elaine stated, "Let's colonize design", let's colonize design with less standards and limitation with more cultural diversity and perspective. Then, "colonization" in design will eventually become a "globalization" of creativity. The symposium of diverse cultural designs should not only be a media for people to recognize and respect, it should be a platform for people to get in touch outside the systematic design world. We as future designers should focus on promoting those designs instead of criticizing the lack of respect. I appreciate the insight of different cultural intepretation in this cd lecture. The intepretation of dominos inspired me to alienate myself from the "conventional" standard of what things should be. </p>
