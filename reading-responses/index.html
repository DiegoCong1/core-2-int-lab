	<h1>Reading Response 1</h1>
	<p>while reading "A Vernacular Web", I was fascinated by how expressions evolved within a community. From early on tiny pixels to well-portrayed AI-generated art.
The web really documents the evolution of virtual human interaction and expression. To me WWW is still a modern technology
that was invented a few years back, and we don't acknowledge it as a part of history despite the decades that have passed. Looking through the
designs, "Bizzare" could be the definitive description of all animations and designs in the mid-90s. It is interesting to think that back then
people appreciate these bizarre pixels as the modern or the future, and now we acknowledge them with a cool retrospective connotation.
After reading Laurel Schwulst's article, her idea of "we the maker of websites will eventually die one day, but the web will live on", stuck in my head
for a long time. Making a website that suits its purpose (being alive) should be what all web creators are aiming for, and "Dead" websites
can be considered a waste of time in their infinite but limiting life. A website should be a container full of creativity and imagination, it can be anything
we want them to be. To build a website, we should focus on the ideation and the eventual form instead of the skill to code (although also necessary) </p>

	<p>The web's grain took a deep dive explaining the fundenmental elements and the purpose of websites (screen). Frank first mentioned the diverse properties of elements, then using examples showed why and how we should portray the web to our audience. From his article I realized we have to constantly think about the presentation than the ideas. Sometimes the ideas are lost due to technical difficulties. In short, we should build a webpage on how its gonna present, and not how its gonna work theratically. The Hockney's work really emphisized the concept of assigning space to the content's mass. The webpage should be build block by block in sequence, so there's always a "next step", otherwise, the presentation may collapse. Edgelessness is more powerful than we think. There's plenty of edgelessness example out on the website world, however, it is fundenmental if the purpose is to create a wholesome screen experience. The experience of audience lies within details like edgelessness. The greater content is what speaks, and the details are the microphone that make audience engaged. </p>

	<p>The American Artists illustrated a picture of anti-black culture within the 1970s sillicon valley. Through background information of Xerox, apple lisa, and technical choices, the author depicted a white-supreme or white appreciated social taste and norm. The color white was designated to be the primary output or imagery in Silicon valley. From the apple lisa background, to cursor execution and display, the author is hinting the usability and credibility of blackness should be determined by no one. The author also argues that the development of the latter whiteness owes much to blackness as a platform of slowness, complexity, critique, and more. The article itself has a lot of hinting and implication. The emphisis on blackness is the fondaiton of new Gooey systems has repeated over and over again. It seems the author wants to deliver a message: "the black gooey are forgotten, however, the blackness is what got us here today, from Xerox to apple lisa to smartphones, we should remember the black gooey and maybe only the programmers can appreciate them." </p>

	<p> Function as narrative. Reading this article, I had multiple epiphany about product and its end-user. The first concept that attracted my attention is the "form after function". It's quite a interesting concept thinking form after function as a designer, and in reality the customer thinks forms before concepts. Humans are visual animals, we as customers deny pretty much everything that's "ugly" looking before we proceed to understand its function. Later in the article the author mentioned the customer's take on whether a "functional" object is functional or not, an umbrella can be a container for fake jewelry. I recently have come to this understanding too, what I realized from my experience is that what we see and what we vision as a designer sometimes doesn't translate to what the customer sees. Your concept can be so dramatic and inspiring but to the end-users it becomes gold or crap. Then there lies the question, the question I am deemed to find out:"does it even matter for designers to be creative in their own vision while knowing the outcome, the perception from customer might be the complete opposite?". If the context is aiming for functional object for customers, we should only think creatively on the customer's note, right...? And then, does designer's own creative vision matter?  </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 6</h2>
	<p> The article "can the internet be archived?" examined the concept of internet library using real-life examples with great social and political impact. When we think about internet, we shouldn't be referencing to a forever living comprehensive archive. Instead, a editable and controlled library space should be what we see in our head. I have encountered the news about Ukrainian officer claims to shot down a plane, but later I remember seeing massive wave of news saying its false and it was the russian air force who shot it down. It's quite interesting to see how the narration of human society can be manipulated even in today's world. We always says the history is written by the victor, but now it seems the history is and will be written by those who is in charge of the means to spread informations. The WayBack Machine is really an unexpected organization to exist in my understanding. It's quite a extrodanary invention. After reading the article it makes me wonder will it be a time where our internet footprints as regular people disappear. As in we have never existed. Should we archive everything we do just to preserve the existance? And how should we treat our website when we realize the website also has its end. </p>

	<p> The article talks about the regularly injustice have cursed the black community in Detroit. The racial discrimination and racial capitalism have limited the quality of life among black citizens. The commuter "accident" map is very daunting, the author used this article to indicate the progress needed for the prevention of such tragety. Aside from the story, what caught my eyes the most is how the creater of the webpage assigned each paragraph and its corresponding references. A link on the top left indent, hovering citations floating directly on the rightside of the quote. It's quite convienent for me as a reader to keep track of what is happening and what I want to dig further. The whole composiiton of the webpage is relatively clean, the using of line-spacing and letter-spacing are very effective and comfortable for the eyes. User-interface and user-experience should be what we aim for as web designers. User-experience takes a whole percentage of whether our message is being communicated through. Therefore, making our website not only knowledgable but also efficient in its interactive design and purposes should be the priority goal. </p>

	<p> The article is an interview of Mindy Seu and her Cyberfeminism Index. In the article Mindy Seu were asked a series of question towards the purpose of the index, the construction of the website, and the sourcing as well as the format of the website. The website is designed in a way to let audience to scavenge data through scrolling the index. Her idea was to portray this index as a universe of data, which participants(audience) can navigate through themselves instead of having a main navigation tool. Mindy also talked about how she gathered the information from the wayback machine. She find "digging" the "artifact" left on the internet both interesting and challenging. The concept of having cyber topic index really intrigues me. Based on the understanding of wayback machines from previous reading, this cyberfeminism index makes me wonder if our human society should have set up multiple cyber indexs for future reference. There are websites "dying" everyday, and some are vaulable history for future generations. I believe it is only right to publish multiple topic oriented cyber index, and advertise them, to not only have historical records, but also make these indexs accessable by others. If not through this reading, just by typing key words on the internet, I believe I won't get to know or understand the existance of this cyber index. And this may apply to all the cyber indexs out there, we should advertise and promote these vaulable data, to make sure our history is written in full. </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 9</h2>
	<p> In this week's reading, an sci-fi fictional writer called Skawennati was introduced. She wrote multiple stories about indigenous culture and practices in futuristic societies. In the reading, the author thinks Skawennati also challenged some of the indigenous fairy tales and reinterpreted them in a slightly different way. The stories reolves around indigenous culture and future development as well as Skawennati and her own Avatar's spirital connection in the story. In Skawennati's statemnts, she mentioned how avatars and their opposites are interconnected. She wants to be like her avatar, but at the same time in the world she created, she knows the avatar wants to be her too. This notion constructed a realistic imaginary world between the "player" and the avatar. A imaginary world that is fictional but at the same time very emotional and realistic to an extent. Becasue the avatar was created by yourself, it is a part of yourself, you can understand it in some degree. Based on this reading, I was curious about other people's connection between them and their avatar, it could be in video games, or it could be in imagination. How will this connection be applied and practiced when the metaverse eventually arrives, when the avatar is you, and you are the avatar. </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 10</h2>
	<p> Both article in this week's reading emphsized the importance of having an accessible and cultural empowering internet experience. In Glitch Feminism, Mehri and Russell are discussing the conformity and "correct" ideal that was pushed to all internet end-users. They exchanged dialogue focusing on disempowerment of minorities, and examples of real life incidents such as the black memes that are targeting and pressuring the minorities. The article also mentioned a system that categorize minorities differently and the importance to change the system through glitched feminism. Pushing back the pressure and conformity to build a world where everyone is accepted and respected. The Alt text website integrated the idea of accessibility in a more literal way compared with Russell's Glitch Feminism. Bojana and Shannon, the founder of Alt text, created a code format where screen readers can not only read textual contents on the website, but also read a line of description of the image that was previously unaccessible to disabled populations. Their work emphisized flaws existing in today's internet realm, and we should keep updating and troubleshooting these flaws to create a full accessible platform for all population around the world.  </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 11</h2>
	<p> In this week's reading, two concepts were introduced, the amount of digital footprint people generated and the possibility of going back to local digital communities. The majority thinks the internet and our interaction with it are vitural, therefore unvalid or unaccountable. But in reality, our digital footprint on the internet, a purchase on a e-shop, is no different than going to the store irl and pick up a bag of grocery. Big-tech companies such as amazon are picking up our actions and routines everyday, it is no question soon the algorithm can predict our individual's next step and action. The concept of a local community was introduced to me when I was a kid playing video games. Back then when there was no internet (or fast internet like today), we could play local with my friends next door or within the close radius. It's interesting that nowdays internet are currently forcing us to connect with the world, and the connection of close community are neglected. The problem with today's internet is the lack of personal connection in online community, the internet's reach is so far, every individual feel small and unconnected. Perhaps local community can solve the problem and reattach the sense of community back to our life.  </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 12</h2>
	<p> This week's reading is about a Beginner's guide to setting up your own social network. The author is the founder of "friend camp", a small social network that has similar funcitons as twitter but without advertisement and monetizing algorithms. This article is helping those who are interested in starting their own small social networks, preparing them for the outcomes responsibilities they may face. As the author mentioned in the article, there are prices to be paid just to run such network, first of all, you need $10-30 a month to maintain the network, secondly, you have to give few hours a week just to debug and maintain the website and network to make sure it runs properly. third, you have to be there constantly to make sure your user can access the network all year long, it's up to you as the admin to maintain the social circle. I think this article is very informative in terms of guiding people starting their own social network, however like the author mentioned, when you start the network it doesn't mean it will be successful, you have to gather your community, you have to make maintainence, and you have to dedicate time to creating this community. Based on this article, I would like to know how safe is it to communicate on this kind of network, are texts encrypted or is there any form of protection?  </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 13</h2>
	<p> This week's reading talked about how internet companies are taking authority and surveillance upon American citizens. The concept of such authority was not elected in the context of democracy, the author argues it is a surveillance monopoly where the surveillance capitalist hold all epistemic dominance, and have the ability to spread disinformation to violet the rights of a democratic citizens. This all started when there was an surveillance exception where CIA high-rank officers decided to use data collection from private coporations, and soon all private coporation can store and collect data on the internet. The author argues the disinformation are a direct result from surveillance capitalism. The disinformation is hurting the freedom of speech and treating every information online as a weapon instead of a voice. The author later on encourages the government to enforce a political system where digital surveillance from private firms will decrease to minimum and if neccesity. This will eventually protect the freedom of speech and human rights for the american citizen.  </p>
