	<h1>Reading Response 1</h1>
	<p>while reading "A Vernacular Web", I was fascinated by how expressions evolved within a community. From early on tiny pixels to well-portrayed AI-generated art.
The web really documents the evolution of virtual human interaction and expression. To me WWW is still a modern technology
that was invented a few years back, and we don't acknowledge it as a part of history despite the decades that have passed. Looking through the
designs, "Bizzare" could be the definitive description of all animations and designs in the mid-90s. It is interesting to think that back then
people appreciate these bizarre pixels as the modern or the future, and now we acknowledge them with a cool retrospective connotation.
After reading Laurel Schwulst's article, her idea of "we the maker of websites will eventually die one day, but the web will live on", stuck in my head
for a long time. Making a website that suits its purpose (being alive) should be what all web creators are aiming for, and "Dead" websites
can be considered a waste of time in their infinite but limiting life. A website should be a container full of creativity and imagination, it can be anything
we want them to be. To build a website, we should focus on the ideation and the eventual form instead of the skill to code (although also necessary) </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 3</h2>
	<p>The web's grain took a deep dive explaining the fundenmental elements and the purpose of websites (screen). Frank first mentioned the diverse properties of elements, then using examples showed why and how we should portray the web to our audience. From his article I realized we have to constantly think about the presentation than the ideas. Sometimes the ideas are lost due to technical difficulties. In short, we should build a webpage on how its gonna present, and not how its gonna work theratically. The Hockney's work really emphisized the concept of assigning space to the content's mass. The webpage should be build block by block in sequence, so there's always a "next step", otherwise, the presentation may collapse. Edgelessness is more powerful than we think. There's plenty of edgelessness example out on the website world, however, it is fundenmental if the purpose is to create a wholesome screen experience. The experience of audience lies within details like edgelessness. The greater content is what speaks, and the details are the microphone that make audience engaged. </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 4</h2>
	<p>The American Artists illustrated a picture of anti-black culture within the 1970s sillicon valley. Through background information of Xerox, apple lisa, and technical choices, the author depicted a white-supreme or white appreciated social taste and norm. The color white was designated to be the primary output or imagery in Silicon valley. From the apple lisa background, to cursor execution and display, the author is hinting the usability and credibility of blackness should be determined by no one. The author also argues that the development of the latter whiteness owes much to blackness as a platform of slowness, complexity, critique, and more. The article itself has a lot of hinting and implication. The emphisis on blackness is the fondaiton of new Gooey systems has repeated over and over again. It seems the author wants to deliver a message: "the black gooey are forgotten, however, the blackness is what got us here today, from Xerox to apple lisa to smartphones, we should remember the black gooey and maybe only the programmers can appreciate them." </p>
