	<h1>Reading Response 1</h1>
	<p>while reading "A Vernacular Web", I was fascinated by how expressions evolved within a community. From early on tiny pixels to well-portrayed AI-generated art.
The web really documents the evolution of virtual human interaction and expression. To me WWW is still a modern technology
that was invented a few years back, and we don't acknowledge it as a part of history despite the decades that have passed. Looking through the
designs, "Bizzare" could be the definitive description of all animations and designs in the mid-90s. It is interesting to think that back then
people appreciate these bizarre pixels as the modern or the future, and now we acknowledge them with a cool retrospective connotation.
After reading Laurel Schwulst's article, her idea of "we the maker of websites will eventually die one day, but the web will live on", stuck in my head
for a long time. Making a website that suits its purpose (being alive) should be what all web creators are aiming for, and "Dead" websites
can be considered a waste of time in their infinite but limiting life. A website should be a container full of creativity and imagination, it can be anything
we want them to be. To build a website, we should focus on the ideation and the eventual form instead of the skill to code (although also necessary) </p>
