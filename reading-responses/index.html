	<h1>Reading Response 1</h1>
	<p>while reading "A Vernacular Web", I was fascinated by how expressions evolved within a community. From early on tiny pixels to well-portrayed AI-generated art.
The web really documents the evolution of virtual human interaction and expression. To me WWW is still a modern technology
that was invented a few years back, and we don't acknowledge it as a part of history despite the decades that have passed. Looking through the
designs, "Bizzare" could be the definitive description of all animations and designs in the mid-90s. It is interesting to think that back then
people appreciate these bizarre pixels as the modern or the future, and now we acknowledge them with a cool retrospective connotation.
After reading Laurel Schwulst's article, her idea of "we the maker of websites will eventually die one day, but the web will live on", stuck in my head
for a long time. Making a website that suits its purpose (being alive) should be what all web creators are aiming for, and "Dead" websites
can be considered a waste of time in their infinite but limiting life. A website should be a container full of creativity and imagination, it can be anything
we want them to be. To build a website, we should focus on the ideation and the eventual form instead of the skill to code (although also necessary) </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 3</h2>
	<p>The web's grain took a deep dive explaining the fundenmental elements and the purpose of websites (screen). Frank first mentioned the diverse properties of elements, then using examples showed why and how we should portray the web to our audience. From his article I realized we have to constantly think about the presentation than the ideas. Sometimes the ideas are lost due to technical difficulties. In short, we should build a webpage on how its gonna present, and not how its gonna work theratically. The Hockney's work really emphisized the concept of assigning space to the content's mass. The webpage should be build block by block in sequence, so there's always a "next step", otherwise, the presentation may collapse. Edgelessness is more powerful than we think. There's plenty of edgelessness example out on the website world, however, it is fundenmental if the purpose is to create a wholesome screen experience. The experience of audience lies within details like edgelessness. The greater content is what speaks, and the details are the microphone that make audience engaged. </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 4</h2>
	<p>The American Artists illustrated a picture of anti-black culture within the 1970s sillicon valley. Through background information of Xerox, apple lisa, and technical choices, the author depicted a white-supreme or white appreciated social taste and norm. The color white was designated to be the primary output or imagery in Silicon valley. From the apple lisa background, to cursor execution and display, the author is hinting the usability and credibility of blackness should be determined by no one. The author also argues that the development of the latter whiteness owes much to blackness as a platform of slowness, complexity, critique, and more. The article itself has a lot of hinting and implication. The emphisis on blackness is the fondaiton of new Gooey systems has repeated over and over again. It seems the author wants to deliver a message: "the black gooey are forgotten, however, the blackness is what got us here today, from Xerox to apple lisa to smartphones, we should remember the black gooey and maybe only the programmers can appreciate them." </p>

	<p> Function as narrative. Reading this article, I had multiple epiphany about product and its end-user. The first concept that attracted my attention is the "form after function". It's quite a interesting concept thinking form after function as a designer, and in reality the customer thinks forms before concepts. Humans are visual animals, we as customers deny pretty much everything that's "ugly" looking before we proceed to understand its function. Later in the article the author mentioned the customer's take on whether a "functional" object is functional or not, an umbrella can be a container for fake jewelry. I recently have come to this understanding too, what I realized from my experience is that what we see and what we vision as a designer sometimes doesn't translate to what the customer sees. Your concept can be so dramatic and inspiring but to the end-users it becomes gold or crap. Then there lies the question, the question I am deemed to find out:"does it even matter for designers to be creative in their own vision while knowing the outcome, the perception from customer might be the complete opposite?". If the context is aiming for functional object for customers, we should only think creatively on the customer's note, right...? And then, does designer's own creative vision matter?  </p>

	<h2>Reading Response 6</h2>
	<p> The article "can the internet be archived?" examined the concept of internet library using real-life examples with great social and political impact. When we think about internet, we shouldn't be referencing to a forever living comprehensive archive. Instead, a editable and controlled library space should be what we see in our head. I have encountered the news about Ukrainian officer claims to shot down a plane, but later I remember seeing massive wave of news saying its false and it was the russian air force who shot it down. It's quite interesting to see how the narration of human society can be manipulated even in today's world. We always says the history is written by the victor, but now it seems the history is and will be written by those who is in charge of the means to spread informations. The WayBack Machine is really an unexpected organization to exist in my understanding. It's quite a extrodanary invention. After reading the article it makes me wonder will it be a time where our internet footprints as regular people disappear. As in we have never existed. Should we archive everything we do just to preserve the existance? And how should we treat our website when we realize the website also has its end. </p>
